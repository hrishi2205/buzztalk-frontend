# Copy to `.env` and adjust as needed.
# If you run the backend locally on a different port, change this.
VITE_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:5000

# Normally in local dev you DO NOT set VITE_API_URL so the frontend uses
# window.location.origin (e.g. http://localhost:5173) and the Vite dev server
# proxies /api -> VITE_PROXY_TARGET above.
# Uncomment ONLY if you want to bypass the dev proxy and hit the backend directly.
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Same idea for the websocket/socket.io endpoint. Leave unset to reuse API base.
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
